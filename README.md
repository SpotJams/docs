### A way to facilitate the music

There are many people out there that like music.  It seems like music has
been an important thing throughout human culture as well.  When it became
possible to record music the profits of that industry became more and more
found in the distribution of music, instead of the creation of music.
It would be really cool to enable more musicians to profit from their careers
so that more of them can dedicate their lives to music. Through this, great
value would be added to the world - more people can experience the life of a
musician and more people can experience live events.

### The Experiment

We believe that if musicians can more easily connect with one another and have
some of their more boring tasks automated, more of them will be able to pursue
sucessful careers as musicians. SpotJams is a way to explore these possibilities and more.

### Possibilities

- musician profile system with matchmaking
- Digital manager - automate the non-musical duties
